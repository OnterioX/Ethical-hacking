# Ethical-hacking
The purpose of this project is to show how to hack computer systems like black hat hackers and able to secure the them as well.
The tools that be used are Kali Linux via Virtual Machine, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy, OWASP Juice Shop and wireshark.  To avoid trouble I will be using a virtual machine to set up it's own computer and network and attack that selected computer.
The goal of this project is to be able to hack into computer systems by installing backdoors, websites and network. The final functionality of the project will be a video showing the success of gaining access to a user computer. 
For the first sprint I plan to have every software and framework established before using it start attacking computers. Second sprint I will start by gaining access to the networks and deactivating users from the network. Third Sprint will be WEP Cracking. Fourth Sprint will be network hacking gaining access to the network and creating a word list. Fith Sprint will be using that wordlist as an attack to crack WPA & WPA2 network security. and the Final Sprint will be showing how to configure the settings to secure your network from hackers.
Note: I'm still in the novice area of using linux for hacking and it's still a process that I'm currently doing. However, this is something I would really like to do for my project if there's any other helpful tips you can give to ensure that everything meets your guidelines. Please do not hesistate to reach out to me.
